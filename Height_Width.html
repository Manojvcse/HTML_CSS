            I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to share with you a project I've been working on recently that's both challenging and exciting: I'm building a robot that walks like a dog. The robot has eight servo motors in total, with each leg equipped with two servos â€“ one for the hip and one for the knee. This setup is intended to mimic the natural movement of a dog's legs, providing a realistic walking motion.
The journey began with a fascination for robotics and a desire to create something that could move autonomously. Initially, the project seemed straightforward: design a four-legged robot and program it to walk. However, as I delved deeper, I realized the complexities involved in replicating the intricate movements of a living creature.
The first step was to design the mechanical structure of the robot. I opted for a quadrupedal design, as it offers stability and mimics the natural gait of a dog. Each leg needed to be both strong and flexible, capable of supporting the robot's weight while also allowing for a range of motions. The hip and knee joints, powered by servo motors, provide the necessary articulation.
